//We use config so that we don't need to set the author's name or any other item that is always the same
//npm config set init-author-name "Armin Abdi"

//There is an intermediate method
// npm set init-author-name "Armin Abdi"


//If we forgot what we set, we can get it by receiving
// npm get init-author-name
// npm config get init-author-name
