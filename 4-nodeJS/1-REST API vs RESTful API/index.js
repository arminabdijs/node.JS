// REST API: An API that uses REST architecture principles to enable communication between client and server.

// RESTful API: An API that fully and strictly implements all REST principles.


// Key Difference:
// REST API: May follow some REST principles, but not necessarily all.

// RESTful API: Strictly adheres to all REST principles, such as being stateless
// and using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).


// Conclusion:
// A RESTful API is a more precise and standard-compliant version of a REST API.
// The main difference lies in the level of adherence to REST principles.
